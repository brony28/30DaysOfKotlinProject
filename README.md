# Library Management System (commandline)

The project is built from the concepts I am confident with. The projects describes a demo of taking and returning book from a particular library using functions. The user inputs their option and takes/returns the book by entering the book name(with the help of when statement and object call). The concept of nullability is implemented when a wrong input is found in the List of objects having Class called Library(). 

The Library Class have 2 methods that shows the its function.

MutableList is used to store the names of the books/novels that the user enters.
